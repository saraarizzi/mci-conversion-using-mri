# Predicting MCI Conversion using MRI

Objective: 
MCI is the prodromal phase of AD.
It presents as an imperative intervention window, but it is difficult to detect which subjects convert to AD and which ones remain stable.
Early predictions will allow early treatment of patients with MCI before they convert to AD, which could reduce the number of patients with AD.

Main info:

- Dataset: Excerpt from ADNI Database

- Running Environment: Google Colab

- Framework: PyTorch

This repository has a single notebook, that contains both the preprocessing and the model training.
